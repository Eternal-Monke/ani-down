## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🧩 How It Works (Planned)

Ani-Down uses curated anime sources that provide direct download links accessible via shell scripting. It leverages:

- **`curl`** for HTTP requests and fetching metadata  
- fzf for fuzzy, interactive selection
- Intelligent parsing to extract video/manga links without JavaScript dependencies
